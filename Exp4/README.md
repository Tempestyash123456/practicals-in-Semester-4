## Experiment: 4

**Aim:** To find minimum spanning tree using kruskal's algorithm

**Algorithm:** Below are the steps for finding MST using Kruskalâ€™s algorithm:

1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight. 
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If the cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it. 
3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
